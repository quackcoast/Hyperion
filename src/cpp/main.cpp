// I need to call this function first!!
// hyperion::core::initialize_attack_tables();

// I need to call Zobrist::initialize_keys() right when the program starts in main once I build made out !!
// Also I think I might just put the uci in here maybe. Seems like it fits in main

// look into these: gprof, Valgrind/Callgrind, Visual Studio Profiler, XCode Instruments
// They will show where the bottle necks are in the code. very important to look at AFTER the code works and compiles
